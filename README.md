some code snippets (potentially useful for exercises etc.)

welcome, 

here every week i will probably commit some code and hints for exercise sheets (only look if you can't solve them, i.e struggle solving the problem)

if you have code related problems, but are fairly certain your approach is correct, then drop me a message via mail and submit your code for me to take a look at it.

overall, i must say it is far more useful that you first consult yourself and/or a friend and/or the internet before reaching directly out for me (considering the pedagogical experience of understanding and solving errors in your code). you can of course also directly reach out to me and i will be more than helpful to do so!

in this repository, that i will also link to the polybox (if i figure out how :) ), i will upload any code i might still give you along with code snippets that may also help you in implementing your code. (of course i will not post any solutions)

especially when we reach the second half of the term you will probably benefit from this, when the code you write involves several lines of code and is based less on fundamental, but higher level concepts!!!


i look forward to this !!!
